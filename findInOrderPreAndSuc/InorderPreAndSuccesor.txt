 recently encountered with a question in an interview at e-commerce company. The interviewer asked the following question:

There is BST given with root node with key part as integer only. The structure of each node is as follows:

struct Node
{
    int key;
    struct Node *left, *right ;
};
You need to find the inorder successor and predecessor of a given key. In case the given key is not found in BST, then return the two values within which this key will lie.

Following is the algorithm to reach the desired result. Its a recursive method:
