Given two binary trees, check if the first tree is subtree of the second one. A subtree of a tree T is a tree S consisting of a node in T and all of its descendants in T.

The subtree corresponding to the root node is the entire tree; the subtree corresponding to any other node is called a proper subtree.

For example, in the following case, Tree1 is a subtree of Tree2.


        Tree1
          x  
        /    \ 
      a       b
       \
        c


        Tree2
              z
            /   \
          x      e
        /    \     \
      a       b      k
       \
        c
We have discussed a O(n2) solution for this problem. In this post a O(n) solution is discussed. The idea is based on the fact that inorder and preorder/postorder uniquely identify a binary tree. Tree S is a subtree of T if both inorder and preorder traversals of S arew substrings of inorder and preorder traversals of T respectively.
